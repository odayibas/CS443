# CS443 – Cloud Computing &amp; Mobile Applications

## Catalog Description

Hands-on introduction to cloud computing and developing cloud-native (esp. mobile) applications. Cloud application models, services and infrastructures (virtualization, data center networking, distributed file systems), cluster computing systems (e.g. Spark), fundamental trade offs and methods (CAP theorem, NoSQL systems), architecture (modern n-tier, lambda, kappa) and applications (big data analytics, large-scale web services). Programming to develop scalable applications running on the cloud.

Basically, this course has the following learning outcomes:

* What is cloud computing? Why we need it and in which cases we can use that paradigm (__Module-1: What is it?__).
* How to implement a cloud system? What is essential to build an efficient cloud solution (__Module-2: How to implement it?__)
* How to sustain a cloud application in both business and technical terms (__Module-3: How to manage it?__)

## Assessment Methods

| Item       | Type          | Weight  |
|:---------- |:------------- | -------:|
| Quizzes/HWs| Written/Imp.  | 10%     |

## Project

Each student is expected to be part of a team (size of 3 people) to implement a cloud-native mobile-first application. Grading criteria will include the operational features of the application (we will cover these features in detail throughout the semester). During the classes each team will present: reports and demo/presentation on at least but not limited to the implementation details, external services, cloud characteristics, performance analysis, etc.
