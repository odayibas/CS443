## FAQ

__Q1:__ Which mobile development frameworks (iOS/Android/etc.) will be used during the course? <br/>
__A1:__ Please do not consider that course as an "App development course". "Mobile App development" is not one of the learning outcome objectives. We will use "mobile applications" as the main theme for implementing a cloud computing solution.

__Q2:__ Which cloud service provider (vendor) will be used during the course (tutorials and/or project)? <br/>
__A2:__ Any tool/framework of a major vendor can be used (please refer to "catalog desc." part). Project deliverables (reports/presentation/demo/etc.) will include details about external services used (but it has no effect on grading). In terms of our learning objectives, we will be more into "how you use these services/tools under which conditions".

__Q3:__ Do you regularly use spare hour of the course (Monday 10:30)? <br/>
__A3:__ No, not by default. We will not use the spare slot regularly but it will be used to make up any missed class hour. A notice mail will be sent to all registered students via STARS system in any such cases (as early as possible).

__Q4:__ Are you planning to use any textbook? <br />
__A4:__ No, it is hard to find a book that covers the topics of that course. The main objective is to design a course that conveys the both technical and business sides of cloud systems. Therefore, following this web page for slides (I upload/update slides weekly) and "Bookmarks" is the best way to cope with it.

__Q5:__ Is it possible to form a 5-person project team? <br />
__A5:__ No, it is not possible.

__Q6:__ I'm taking that course without a prior computer networking course. It may be a bit hard follow -at least- the terminology used in the course. What do you suggest? <br />
__A6:__ You can use that walk through: ["Your App Lives on a Network: Networking for Web Developers by Wim Godden"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0JdGOYuQzc) It takes around an hour and it seems the presenter covers all the basics (which is enough for this course). If you prefer more formal content, Udacity also offers a free course called ["Networking for Web Developers"](https://www.udacity.com/course/networking-for-web-developers--ud256)
